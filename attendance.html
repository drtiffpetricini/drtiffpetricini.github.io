            <h2>Attendance</h2>
            <p>Students are expected to attend class and actively participate in all aspects of the learning process. This includes class discussions, written work, and in-class activities. National and local studies have shown a direct correlation between attendance and grade performance. Therefore, attendance is considered mandatory.</p>
            <p>Students who miss more than 10% of the regularly scheduled class meetings due to unexcused absences are subject to failing the course.</p>
            <p>For asynchronous courses, participation expectations apply instead of attendance. Blended remote sections and specific attendance requirements will be outlined clearly in class.</p>
            <p>Students enrolled in TR sections may not exceed 3 unexcused absences, while MWF sections may not exceed 5 unexcused absences. For the purposes of this course, "excused absences" include verifiable medical or family emergencies, University approved activities, illness, and other absences as outlined in the University’s Class Attendance policy.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Zoom Recording and Remote Attendance</h2>
            <p>If you are in an “in-person” class, you are expected to be in the physical classroom. However, Dr. P’s courses are web-enhanced, meaning some activities may be conducted online and will be noted in your course schedule in Canvas.</p>
            <p>Class lectures for all sections are recorded on Zoom and are used solely for educational purposes. In certain cases, students may attend via Zoom with prior permission due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., contagious illness, weather issues). The student must email Dr. P before class to request permission. Remote attendance via Zoom should be used only as an exception.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Late Work Policies</h2>
            <p><strong>NO LATE FINALS WILL BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT A UNIVERSITY-APPROVED EXCUSE.</strong></p>
            <p>Missed lectures and assignment discussions will not be "re-taught." It is your responsibility to obtain any missed information from classmates. Grades for late exams and assignments (not due to excused absences) will be reduced by 10% per 24-hour period late.</p>
            <p>Schedules and due dates are tentative, so check Canvas regularly for updates and attend class on time for any announcements about changes.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Life Happens Card</h2>
            <p>Above, you will find a "Life Happens Card." This entitles you to one free late assignment submission without a university-approved excuse. Print it out and attach it to your late assignment. You only get one per semester, so use it wisely! Note that these cannot be used for exams or finals.</p>
