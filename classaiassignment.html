            <h2>Can I use generative AI like ChatGPT or Dall-E for any of Dr. P's courses?</h2>
            <p>The answer to this question isn’t without many caveats. The short answer is:</p>
            <p>You may only use generative AIs in ways that we discuss in class or if you have explicit permission which you've sought prior to creating your deliverable (e.g., a video or essay) or finishing your assessment (e.g., an exam).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Can I use generative AI like ChatGPT and Dall-E in all my courses?</h2>
            <p>No. Different faculty have different policies, and these policies might even differ from course to course. The best way to determine if you are allowed to use these tools in your course is to be transparent and ask your instructor directly.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What exactly is plagiarism anyway? Do I still have to find a source if I just "know" something?</h2>
            <p>This is a great question that will become clearer as you grow at the university! For now, I encourage you all to earn your Academic Integrity Certificate. It doesn’t take long and can help answer a lot of your questions.</p>

            <h2>Dr. P.'s Three Rules about Using AI</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Be truthful about your use of GAI tools.</strong> Transparency is essential. I will let you know when I use AI in our class, and I expect you to do the same when you use AI for your assignments.</li>
                <li><strong>Use it to help you, not to replace you.</strong> AI should support your work, not complete it for you. Use temperance and prudence in making ethical choices.</li>
                <li><strong>Have the courage to take chances.</strong> This is a new world, with many possibilities. If you have a creative idea, go for it—while following the first two guidelines.</li>
            </ol>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Artificial Intelligence Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Generative AI tools can be helpful but require caution. These technologies create content (text, images, video) and are unable to discern complex intentions or nuances.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tasks often require critical reasoning and audience awareness that AI cannot provide.</li>
                <li>AI may produce false “data results” or unsupportable assertions, which are unacceptable for assignments.</li>
                <li>AI paraphrasing often results in mosaic plagiarism and should be avoided.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you use any AI tools, be mindful of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Penn State’s G9 Academic Integrity policy</strong> prohibits false information, invented sources, and misrepresented work.</li>
                <li><strong>Properly document and cite any AI use</strong> to comply with university policies on academic honesty.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Academic Integrity Information</h2>
            <p>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. At Penn State, all students are expected to uphold these principles.</p>
            <p>Violating academic integrity, as outlined by <strong>Penn State policy G-9</strong>, can have severe consequences, including failing the assignment or course and potential academic penalties.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Writing Expectations</h2>
            <p>As Penn State students, you are expected to meet a high standard in all written and oral assignments. Each of your assignments will be reviewed with these standards in mind, and I am here to support you through every step of the assignment process. Utilize university resources and contact me if you need additional help.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Due Dates</h2>
            <p>Assignment due dates will be posted in Canvas as each weekly module is prepared. Assignments are due at the beginning of class, unless otherwise specified. If you have difficulty finding the course calendar, message me directly.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Exam Policy</h2>
            <p>Exams and quizzes will be administered on the scheduled dates and times. Any missed exam requires a university-approved excuse, and makeup arrangements must be made accordingly.</p>
